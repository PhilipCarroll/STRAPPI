# STRAPPI 
STRAPPI is a website that will eventually function as an ECommerce platform. I want to showcase products with high quality imagery and 
in time I will build in a blog. This will act as a means to consistently add new content and have the site index with SEO,
driving organic traffic and giving me a mechanism to redirect consumers toward products on the site, increasing sales.

For this MileStone1 project I am focusing on the layout and overall style of the static frontend portion in order to develop the skills 
I have acquired so far in the first Module of the Code Institute course.


## UX
### User Experience Design (UXD)
In order to develop my overall plan this project I used the 5 planes of User Experience Design-Strategy, Scope, Strucrture, Skeleton and Surface.
I aimed to answer a few key questions in each plane to guide my decision making process.

#### Strategy:
1. Who is my audience?  
This is a B2C platform for watch enthusiast, casual watch fans, and anyoen looking to buy a gift or watch related product.
2. What makes this site special?
STRAPPI aims to provide an experience reminiscent of walking into a brick and mortar watch shop. I want to echo the feeling of entering
and browsing a highstreet watch retail liek you would in one of Europe's many shopping districts.
3. How can we trigger the emotional response to buy?
Part of the brick and mortar shopping experience is the visual sensation of feasting your eyes on products in their best light. You are greeted with
well presented items complimented by other fine materials and alternatives. Layout and imagery will be the focus in regards to coverting browsers to customers.

#### Scope: 
1. What features will be included in this project?
This is a static frontend project using only HTML and CSS and so there are limitations to the features and content that are possible.
The main goal for this project is to build the overall structure and layout including placement of future features. 
2. What do users need/want?
Intuitive navigation. Minimum clicks/taps to locate desired content - product listings/blog/contact etc.

#### Structure:
I'm aiming to keep things as simple as possible when it comes to the navigation of the site with the idea that regardless of the level of content added the 
overall structure does not need to change and ensures returning customers are presented with a familiar platform.
 I want to begin with 5 main pages to the site. These will be the headings in the Navigation bar of the site and the first step to uncovering 
more information for the user. They will the be - 
* Home Page
* Shop
* Blog
* About
* Contact

#### Skeleton:
My plan is to use the home page as a window shopping element to actively entice users toward the other areas of the site. Users 
that entere the site find themselves on the home page and will naturally begin to scroll(encouraged by the content hinting concpet). 
They will discover sections that will not not only teach them what the site has to offer but actively engage them to visit the different areas.

##### Some examples-
* A snippet of a blog article with an image with a "->Read More->" style CTA that will open up the article on the blog page.
* An image of a well known watch on a third party strap option accompanied by "->Shop Straps->" CTA button opening up the shop page.


#### Surface:


### User Stories:
* With this website I want to offer watch enthusiasts and casual shoppers a place to browse products and watch
related content. I want to engage visitors with high quality images and turn them in to loyal customers by 
I have decided to break my users in to 4 personas. Each persona defined will have a "First Time Visitor" and "Returning Visitor"
story. 

* I researched types of consumers in order to define my personas and have loosely based Users 1-4 on the 
4 types outlined here - https://www.beyondthehedgecreative.com/4-different-types-consumers-market/
I also added a 5th story, the Fantasy Shopper.
