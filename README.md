# STRAPPI 
STRAPPI is a website that will eventually function as an ECommerce platform. I want to showcase products with high quality imagery and 
in time I will build in a blog. This will act as a means to consistently add new content and have the site index with SEO,
driving organic traffic and giving me a mechanism to redirect consumers toward products on the site, increasing sales.

For this MileStone1 project I am focusing on the layout and overall style of the static frontend portion in order to develop the skills 
I have acquired so far in the first Module of the Code Institute course.

story.
